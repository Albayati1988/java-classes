Polymorphism:
    Polymorphism allows us to perform same action in different ways. There are two types of polymorphism
    early binding compile time and time runtime or late binding. polymorphism that is acheive with the help
    of method overloading is called early binding or compile time Polymorphism. When we achieve the
    Polymorphism with the he;p of method overriding it is called run time Polymorphism.
Why we should learn polymorphism?
    Polymorphism allows us to write less cod and call multiple methods.
Polymorphism Syntax:
    1) for Static polymorphism we only need to overload a method.
    2) for the dynamic Polymorphism we need to extend from a class we need to override the methods from
    parent class the we want to use in Polymorphism
