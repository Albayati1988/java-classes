Sets:
     Sets do not allow duplicate values. There are three main types of sets
     1-HashSet    2-LinkedHasSet      3-TreeSet
HashSet:(Most Widely used)
     Upside: Speed it's the fastest
     Downside: it does not maintain the insertion order.
LinkedHashSet:
     Upside: maintains the insertion order.
     Downside: it's slower than HashSet
TreeSet:
     Upside: keep the Data sorted
     Downside: it's slower than all
Map:
    Map allow us to store data in the form of key value pairs. Just like Sets we have three main types of maps
    as well
    1)HashMap      2)LinkedHashMap            3) TreeMap

    HashMap:(Most Widely used)
         Upside: Speed it's the fastest
         Downside: it does not maintain the insertion order.
    LinkedHashMap:
         Upside: maintains the insertion order.
         Downside: it's slower than HashMap
    TreeMap:
         Upside: keep the Data sorted
         Downside: it's slower than all.
