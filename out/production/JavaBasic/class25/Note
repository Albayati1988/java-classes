Abstraction:
    Allows us to simplify code by hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to the
    user. in Java we can achieve this in two ways 1) Abstract classes 2) interface
Interface:
    It is very similar to an abstract class. We can have private methods static methods default
    methods abstract methods we can be static in an interface.We can't have instance fields
    in an interface and because we don't have instance field we also can't have a constructor inan interface
When we should use interface:
   when object are closely related to each other and there is a  "Is a" relationship between classes
   then we should go with abstract classes if we want to use abstraction. If object are not related to each
   other then we should implement abstraction with the help of interfaces.
