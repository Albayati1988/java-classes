Operators:
    operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition subtractions we can compare
    thing if two entities are same or not if a numbers greater than the other number or not.
    there are three type of operators. They are arithmetic operators, Relational operator and logical operators.
Arithmetic operators :
    We use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. Like addition, subtraction etc.
    + ==> addition
    - ==> subtraction
    /==> Division
    * ==> multiplication
    % ==> modulus , remainder


Relational operator.
    relational operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. for example if something is bigger than
    other thing or if two numbers are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not .
    == => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if dame w get true otherwise we get false.
    != => used to check if two variable don't contain the same value. we get a true if they are not same.
