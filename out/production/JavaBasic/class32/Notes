FileHandling
    Reading and writing data to files is called filHandling.
    1)To read or write the data first we need to the path or location where we will be
    reading or writing that file.
    2) We need to navigate to that location or bring the file into the memory so that java program
    can process the data from that file. We use two classes to navigate one is called FileInputStream and
    the other one is called FileOutputStream. When we have to read the data we use FileInputStream and
    when we have to write the data we use the FileOutputStream.
    3) We need to know about a class that knows how to read and write the data from that specific
    file for examples we use Properties class when we have to read that data from the properties file. We use
    XSSFWorkbook to read and write the data from the Excel files.

Why should we learn about FileHandling?
    1)We will be storing data like username passwords URLs type of browsers etc in configuration files
    2) When we need to perform data driven testing we will be storing and reading all the data from files
    like xlsx or csv files.
How To Read/Write data from files
1) get the path
2) use FileInputStream/FileOutStream to navigste.
3) use a cpecialized class llike properties or XSSFWorkbook.

What are Exception
    Exception are runtime issues that can stop normal flow of our programs and can abruptly terminate
    the programs which is very bad and leads to bad user experience.
Exception Handling:
    We stop the program from terminating abruptly, and we try to mitigate the issue we provide a
    backup code. And convert the error message to simple text.
